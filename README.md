# rust_tutorial 🦀

Welcome to my Rust learning journey! This repo documents my step-by-step process of learning the Rust programming language, inspired by [this YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ_J9WH6CGk&t=2s). My goal is to build a **full-stack Electronic Medical Records (EMR)** system using Rust — a modern, fast, and safe systems language.

## 📚 Why Rust?

I've chosen Rust for this journey because:
- It's blazing fast ⚡
- Memory-safe without garbage collection 🧠
- Perfect for building reliable and efficient systems — ideal for a secure EMR app 🏥

---

## 🧠 Learning Plan

I'll follow the tutorial and expand from there by building small projects to reinforce each concept. Eventually, I’ll transition into web development with Rust using frameworks like `Rocket` or `Axum`.

| `02_variables/`     | Exploring variable bindings, immutability, etc. |
| `03_functions/`     | Writing and calling functions in Rust           |
| `04_control_flow/`  | Ifs, loops, and match statements                |
| `05_structs_enums/` | Data types and enums for custom logic           |
| `...`               | More modules as I learn more!                   |

## 💡 Final Goal: Full-stack EMR App

I'll eventually use Rust for the backend of an **EMR (Electronic Medical Records)** system. This will include:
- Secure patient data storage
- Appointment and record management
- Authentication/authorization
- Fast and scalable API

Frontend stack is still TBD — possibly using a lightweight JS framework or going full Rust with `Yew`.

## 🚀 Stay Tuned

As I get deeper into Rust, I’ll document bugs, solutions, and reflections along the way. Feel free to follow, fork, or suggest improvements!
